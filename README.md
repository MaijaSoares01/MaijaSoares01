I am a TUD (Technological University of Dublin) Business Computing graduate. I moved from Cape Town, South Africa, to Ireland nearly thirteen years ago. I love programming in Java and C and web design using HTML. I excel at creative thinking, problem-solving, and innovation. I have interned at both Hubli (previously MeetingsBooker) and SAP. I got accepted into the SAP STAR Program in May 2021. Getting an internship with SAP was a significant accomplishment, and getting there took a lot of work.
 
Another outlet that has a positive influence on me is art. I have tried many art mediums, such as painting, charcoal, clay and wire sculpture, collage, and digital. Review my online art portfolio:
