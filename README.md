I am currently a third-year, studying Business Computing at TUD (Technological University of Dublin). I moved to Ireland nearly eleven years ago from Cape Town, South Africa. I'm currently interning at MeetingsBooker and this summer will be interning at SAP Ireland. I love programming in Java and C, as well as web design using HTML. I excel at creative thinking, problem-solving and design.

One of my passions is video games with some of my favourites being, The Last of Us, Assassins Creed, Final Fantasy and The Legend of Zelda. Games have always had a profound impact on me.
I've picked up the following skills through the media of video games,
-Critical thinking skills
-Teamwork
-Strategy skills
-Explore the world and get to know all types of people
-It's okay to be challenged
-Always keep trying
Another outlet that has a positive influence on me is art. I have tried many mediums of art such as painting, charcoal, clay and wire sculpture, collage and digital. Review my online art portfolio:

In short, I'm a quirky gaming nerd, a self-proclaimed try-hard and an art lover.
